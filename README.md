# LinkedList_Implementation-AP_Course
At this repository you can find implementation of LinkedList.

A list is a data structure used to store elements. One of the types of lists is the famous 
LinkedList, which you are probably more or less familiar with it.

In this exercise, I implemented a LinkedList that holds an integer.
